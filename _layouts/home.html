Hello, thanks for stopping by! I'm Meraldo. I'm a budding data scientist and writer based in Singapore. I am passionate about languages, NLP and Big Data.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently working as an AI Apprentice at <a href="https://www.aisingapore.org/"> AI Singapore </a>, where I am building an chatbot that can respond to human questions and pinpoint a specific information within a document. I recently <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-and-output-layers-in-bidaf-an-illustrated-guide-with-minions-f2e101a10d83">wrote</a> about BiDAF — the NLP model that powers this chatbot.

Prior to that, I worked as a Senior Analyst at <a href = "https://datarama.com">Datarama</a>, a start-up that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline due diligence processes. You can read more about my work and background <a href = "https://meraldoantonio.github.io/about/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This website serves as a repository of projects I've undertaken, quick tutorials I write to reinforce my learning and my reflection on being a budding data scientist. Below are the most recent entries I posted. You can find a complete list of entries <a href = "https://meraldoantonio.github.io/blogposts/">here</a>. I am also an active writer on <a href="https://medium.com/@meraldo.antonio">Medium.</a>
