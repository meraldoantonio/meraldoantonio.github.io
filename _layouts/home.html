I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore.

I am currently working as a Senior Analyst at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline due diligence processes. I lead due diligence projects mainly in Indonesia – my country of birth – and also neighboring Southeast Asian countries. In addition, I also contribute to the development of Datarama's AI-powered due diligence platform.

Below are the most recent posts I've written.
