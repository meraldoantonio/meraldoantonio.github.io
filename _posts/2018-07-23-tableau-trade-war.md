excerpt: "Using Tableau, I explained the background and the consequences of the trade war between the US and China"

---

The trade between the US and China is the world's largest bilateral trading relationship and constitutes one of the most important components of the global economy. The ongoing trade war between the two economies, instigated by Donald Trump, risks upending this crucial trade relationship.

In the following Tableau dashboard, I explored the roots behind the trade war and its potential impacts.
The dashboard was first published on [Datarama's media page](https://datarama.com/index.php/media/).
