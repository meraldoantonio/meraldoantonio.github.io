*Apache Pig is an integral component of the Hadoop ecosystem. Since his birth more than a decade ago, he has helped thousands of analysts around the world make sense of massive data sets. Despite his importance, few people outside of the big data sector have heard of him, and some who are acquainted with him have only vague idea about his usage. A few days ago, I had the pleasure to sit down and talk with Apache Pig himself. Our discussion covered many topics ‚Äî from his founding philosophy to practical guidance on writing his language, Pig Latin. Below is the excerpt of this interview. You can find a copy of this article in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/interview-with-apache-pig-theory-and-practical-guide-6c44f06a4ca9).*


# Hi Pig! Thank you for this interview opportunity!

Thank you! It‚Äôs my pleasure to give this interview and gain some additional exposure for myself.
You know, I‚Äôm tired of people confusing me with my buddies in the Hadoop ecosystem. To many, we are just a mishmash of colorfully-named tools that somehow fit together to facilitate the management of Big Data. This has got to change! We play distinct roles in the Hadoop ecosystem and a familiarity with each of us is key to understanding Big Data. It‚Äôs about time that I cleared this confusion and told the world who I really am!

# Great, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm here for! Now for the sake of our casual readers who are just getting started to the world of Big Data, could you please introduce yourself?

Of course! My name is Apache Pig, but most people just call me Pig. I am an open-source tool for analyzing large data sets.
I was conceived by Yahoo in 2006. My conception was driven by Yahoo‚Äôs need to transform and analyze massive amount of data without having to write complex MapReduce programs. In 2007, Yahoo open-sourced me under Apache Software Foundation (hence my first name). Since then, I have been guzzling and analyzing petabytes worth of data all around the world.

# I like your name! Can you elaborate on its origin?

Thanks! It is an interesting name, isn‚Äôt it? Many people think that my name stems from my creators‚Äô effort to stick to the animal theme that permeates the Hadoop world. This is partly true ‚Äî my name was indeed inspired by the eponymous animalüê∑. This name, in turn, led to the adoption of cute nomenclatures for concepts related to me such as *Pig Latin* ‚Å†‚Äîmy programming language‚Äî and *Grunt‚Å†* ‚Äîmy interactive shell (more on these later).
