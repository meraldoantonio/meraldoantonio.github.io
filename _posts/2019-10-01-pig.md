*Apache Pig is an integral component of the Hadoop ecosystem. Since his birth more than a decade ago, he has helped thousands of analysts around the world make sense of massive data sets. Despite his importance, few people outside of the big data sector have heard of him, and some who are acquainted with him have only vague idea about his usage. A few days ago, I had the pleasure to sit down and talk with Apache Pig himself. Our discussion covered many topics — from his founding philosophy to practical guidance on writing his language, Pig Latin.
