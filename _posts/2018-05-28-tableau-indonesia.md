excerpt: "A Tableau dashboard that elaborates the increased emphasis on Indonesian infrastructure development under President Jokowi"

Under President Jokowi's administration, Indonesia has made large strides in improving its crumbling infrastructure. I made the Tableau dashboard below to explore the background behind Jokowi's infrastructure push and its implications. The dashboard is also published on [Datarama's media page](https://datarama.com/index.php/media/).
