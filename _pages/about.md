Hello! Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Meraldo. I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore.

I'm currently working as an AI Apprentice at [AI Singapore](https://www.aisingapore.org/), where I'm building a chatbot that can respond to human questions and pinpoint a specific information within a document. Concurrently, I'm pursuing a [Master in Analytics](http://www.analytics.gatech.edu/) in Georgia Institute of Technology, where I learn state-of-the-art technologies in machine learning.

Prior to AI Singapore, I worked as a Senior Analyst at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses AI to streamline due diligence processes. In Datarama, I led the Southeast Asia due diligence team and contributed to the development of Datarama's AI-powered due diligence platform.

I am passionate about NLP, deep learning and Big Data. In addition, I am also an avid linguist and traveler. I speak fluent Indonesian and English and have intermediate proficiency in Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Malay and Portuguese.

This website serves as a repository of projects I've undertaken, quick tutorials I wrote to reinforce my learning and my reflection on being a budding data scientist. You can find a complete list of entries <a href = "https://meraldoantonio.github.io/blogposts/">here</a>. Also checkout my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@meraldo.antonio) as some of my writings have been featured in Towards Data Science.

Feel free to download a [pdf copy of my résumé]({{ site.url }}/pdf/Resume2.pdf), which contains further details about my background. You can contact me using the email on the sidebar; I am always open to discussions!
