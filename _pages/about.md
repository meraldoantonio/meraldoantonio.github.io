Hello! Thank you for visiting my personal website. My name is Meraldo. I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore.

I am currently working as a Senior Analyst at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline due diligence processes. I lead due diligence projects mainly in Indonesia – my country of birth – and also neighboring Southeast Asian countries. In addition, I also contribute to the development of Datarama's AI-powered due diligence platform.

I'm currently pursuing Georgia Institute of Technology's [Online Master in Analytics (OMSA)](http://www.analytics.gatech.edu/). This awesome program has allowed me to get my hands dirty in the latest concepts of data science. In this blog, you will see posts that recount my experience in OMSA.

I have diverse interests, which have led to a rather unusual career path. Since young, I have always been interested in natural phenomena. Motivated by this passion, I pursued a bachelor's and master's degree in chemistry. As a part of my master's, I had the privilege of completing my thesis in [BASF](https://www.basf.com). Upon graduation, I joined [Lux Research](http://www.luxresearchinc.com/), a consulting firm focused on emerging technologies. It was at Lux Research that I discovered that my interest extended beyond the world of science and emerging technologies. I then decided to enter the reputational due diligence industry, which is an industry dedicated to finding red flags about a particular person or company. I felt that my diverse interests lend themselves well in this industry. Right now, I am trying to hone my skills in analytics with the hope of applying these skills to my current work.

I am also an avid linguist. I am always fascinated by languages and the cultures they represent. I speak fluent Indonesian and English and have intermediate proficiencies in Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Malay and Portuguese. This website also documents my journey to master these languages.

Feel free to download a [pdf copy of my résumé]({{ site.url }}/pdf/Resume.pdf), which contains further details about my background. You can contact me using the email on the sidebar.
