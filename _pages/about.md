I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore.


I am currently working as a Senior Analyst at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline due diligence processes. I lead due diligence projects mainly in Indonesia – my country of birth – and also neighboring Southeast Asian countries. In addition, I also contribute to the development of Datarama's AI-powered due diligence platform.


I'm currently pursuing Georgia Institute of Technology's [Master in Analytics](http://www.analytics.gatech.edu/). This awesome program has allowed me to get my hands dirty in the latest concepts of data science. I post some of the things I learn in this blog.


Due to my diverse interests, I have a rather unusual career path. Before being a due diligence analyst/data scientist, I was a chemist. I have a bachelor's and master's degree in Chemistry from Singapore and Germany.


I am also a linguist. I speak fluent Indonesian, English, Chinese, French, Spanish and also some German, Malay and Portuguese.
