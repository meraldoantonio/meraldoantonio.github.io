I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore.


I work at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to streamline due diligence processes.


I am also a student; I'm currently pursuing Georgia Institute of Technology's [Master in Analytics](http://www.analytics.gatech.edu/).
