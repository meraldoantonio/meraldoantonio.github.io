Hello! Thank you for visiting my personal website. My name is Meraldo. I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore.

I'm currently working as an AI Apprentice at [AI Singapore](https://www.aisingapore.org/), where I am building an chatbot that can respond to human questions and pinpoint a specific information within a document. I recently [wrote](https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-and-output-layers-in-bidaf-an-illustrated-guide-with-minions-f2e101a10d83) about BiDAF — the NLP model that powers this chatbot.

In addition to working full time, I'm also pursuing Georgia Institute of Technology's [Online Master in Analytics (OMSA)](http://www.analytics.gatech.edu/). This awesome program has allowed me to get my hands dirty in the latest concepts of data science. In this blog, you will see posts that recount my experience in OMSA.

Prior to AI Singapore, I worked as a Senior Analyst at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses AI to streamline due diligence processes. I lead due diligence projects from Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. In addition, I also contribute to the development of Datarama's AI-powered due diligence platform.

I am passionate about analytics, NLP and Big Data. In addition, I am also an avid linguist and traveler. I am always fascinated by languages and the cultures they represent. I speak fluent Indonesian and English and have intermediate proficiency in Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Malay and Portuguese. 

Feel free to download a [pdf copy of my résumé]({{ site.url }}/pdf/Resume2.pdf), which contains further details about my background. You can contact me using the email on the sidebar; I am always open to discussions!
