## Who am I?
Hello! Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Meraldo. I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore. I am passionate about NLP, deep learning, Big Data and current affairs. In addition, I am also an avid linguist and traveler. I speak fluent Indonesian and English and have intermediate proficiency in Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Malay and Portuguese.

## What do I do?
I'm currently working as an AI Apprentice at [AI Singapore](https://www.aisingapore.org/), where I'm building a chatbot that can respond to human questions and pinpoint a specific information within a document. Concurrently, I'm pursuing a [Master in Analytics](http://www.analytics.gatech.edu/) in Georgia Institute of Technology, where I learn state-of-the-art technologies in machine learning.

## What did I do before?
Prior to AI Singapore, I worked as a Senior Analyst at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses AI to streamline due diligence processes. In Datarama, I led the Southeast Asia due diligence team and contributed to the development of Datarama's AI-powered due diligence platform.

This website serves as a repository of projects I've undertaken, quick tutorials I wrote to reinforce my learning and my reflection on being a budding data scientist. You can find a complete list of entries <a href = "https://meraldoantonio.github.io/blogposts/">here</a>. Codes for the project are available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/meraldoantonio).

I also write regularly on [Medium](https://medium.com/@meraldo.antonio). I recently published a series of articles about BiDAF, an influential NLP model. [These articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-and-output-layers-in-bidaf-an-illustrated-guide-with-minions-f2e101a10d83) were featured in Towards Data Science.

I have also created and published some interactive dashboards using Tableau. Do check out my page [@Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/meraldo.antonio#!/) to find out more.
