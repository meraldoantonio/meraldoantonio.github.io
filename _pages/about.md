## Who am I?
Hello! Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Meraldo. I'm a budding data scientist based in Singapore. I am passionate about NLP, deep learning, Big Data and current affairs. In addition, I am also an avid linguist and traveler. I speak fluent Indonesian and English and have intermediate proficiency in  Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, German, Malay and Portuguese. Feel free to shoot me a message in any of those languages!

## What do I do?
I'm currently working as an AI Apprentice at [AI Singapore](https://www.aisingapore.org/), where I'm building a chatbot that can respond to human questions and pinpoint a specific information within a document. Concurrently, I'm pursuing a [Master in Analytics](http://www.analytics.gatech.edu/) in Georgia Institute of Technology, where I learn the latest technologies in machine learning.

## Which technical tools do I know?
-**Machine Learning**: I use "standard" machine learning tools on daily basis. These tools include *pandas*, *scikit-learn*, *numpy* and *XGBoost*.
-**Deep Learning**: In the past year, I have been using *PyTorch* for my main NLP project @ AI Singapore and now consider myself a proficient PyTorch user. I have also learned *Tensorflow/Keras* before although I have not used them in a major project.
-**NLP**: NLP is my passion! I have used and deployed state-of-the-art NLP models such as *BiDAF*,*ELMo* and *BERT*.
-**Data Visualization**: I regularly use standard Python visualization libraries such as *matplotlib* and *seaborn*, although my personal favorite is *plotly* and *dash*. I also enjoy building [*Tableau* vizes.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/meraldo.antonio#!/)
-**Big Data**: I am currently taking a course on Big Data, in which I am learning about *Spark* and *Hadoop.* I am working towards getting Hortonworks/Databricks certifications of these technologies in October 2019.

## What did I do before?
Prior to AI Singapore, I worked as a Senior Analyst at [Datarama](https://datarama.com), a start-up that uses AI to streamline due diligence processes. In Datarama, I led the Southeast Asia due diligence team and contributed to the development of Datarama's AI-powered due diligence platform.

This website serves as a repository of projects I've undertaken, quick tutorials I wrote to reinforce my learning and my reflection on being a budding data scientist. You can find a complete list of entries <a href = "https://meraldoantonio.github.io/blogposts/">here</a>. Codes for the project are available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/meraldoantonio).

I also write regularly on [Medium](https://medium.com/@meraldo.antonio). I recently published a series of articles about BiDAF, an influential NLP model. [These articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/modeling-and-output-layers-in-bidaf-an-illustrated-guide-with-minions-f2e101a10d83) were featured in Towards Data Science.

I have also created and published some interactive dashboards using Tableau. Do check out my page [@Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/meraldo.antonio#!/) to find out more.
